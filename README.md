Victor Cipher / De-Cipher Program
I wanted to share a program I am still working on and researching with. Week one we talked about sets and I found a way to add sets into it on line 511-520

This does a difference of sets. See photo below.

I wanted to share the program I created with you. It is a cipher program.

What a good puzzle for a computer science student. 

I hope you enjoy. I really enjoy puzzles like this. I just could not let it go until I got it to work. I had to do some by hand to find out my issues with transposition and agent number code mix up. 
 
Please let me know if you find any issues.

Test areas:
Line 84: official test messages used by referenced websites
Line 109: official cipher to match message
See Line 85: SACRAMENTO UNIVERSITY STUDENT Line 108 is matching cipher message.
 
To use click cipher/decipher with no GUI entry and add padding in Jgrasp window. To use GUI uncomment sections Line 97-105 & Line 54-60 comment out Line 65-86 & Line 107-115 to remove test messages. Keep in mind this is still a work in progress. I still wanted to share this as Sets are used in it.
